Welcome to the Taraform 

    The main idea is that to write the intrastructure  as code (IaC)

    AWS has cloudFormation  Template as the tool for Iac 
    Azure has Resource Manager Template as the tool for Iac

    Now why Taraform ? 
        
        universal tool for Iac 
        we dont have to require to learn different Iac tool for different cloud provider
        we can use the same tool for all cloud provider

Now we have to maintain a main.tf file  to configure the tarraform that is know writing the code for the aws not for azure as the 
tarraform is a universal  tool not for specific one
